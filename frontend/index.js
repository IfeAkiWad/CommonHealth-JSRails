// The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, 
// without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading
// If loaded as usual, stylesheets slow down DOM parsing as they're loaded in parallel, 
// "stealing" traffic from the main HTML document.
